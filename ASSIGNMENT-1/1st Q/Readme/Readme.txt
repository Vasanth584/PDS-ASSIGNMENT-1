1. The data contains five different attributes 'Height (Inches) , Weight (Pounds) , Age , Grip strength , Frailty '

2. The idea is to build a predictive model for frailty

3. Before model building, data cleaning is very important, on observing the data the dependent variable I,e Frailty is binary.

4. Frailty contains Y and N values, we first make them 1's and 0's other than that data looks fine to apply the model

5. One of the best model for binary classification is Logistic regression.

6. Data cleaning and model building is found under src folder
